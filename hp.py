# I finally started reading a series of books over break featuring a certain wizard named Harry Potter. As I progressed through the series, I noticed the page count getting longer and the books getting heavier. While recounting this to a friend who had also read the series, she noted that she felt the writing style of the books seemed to grow as much as the thickness. While the earlier books (particularly the first) seemed to be written to a younger audience with simpler sentences and descriptions, she said, this seemed to get more complex in the later books as Harry also comes of age. I have heard this sentiment confirmed with other readers, and began to wonder whether it would be possible to quantify writing complexity and measure whether there is a significant difference as the series progress. This [notebook](somewhere) is my attempt to quantify it.  
# 
# To quantify the complexity, I look at the following metrics: average word length and sentence length, word frequency within the text, word frequency based on external sources, and the average syntactic complexity of sentences.
# 
# The testing to determine the difference between books is largely inspired by seeing the recent presentation ["Statistics for Hackers"](https://speakerdeck.com/jakevdp/statistics-for-hackers) by Jake VanderPlas, where he introduces simulations, label shuffling, bootstrapping and cross validation as intuitive alternatives to classical statistical approaches. The two methods that I mainly use here are permutation testing ('label shuffling') and the bootstrap. I also used this as a chance to try out the [spaCy](https://spacy.io) library, which bills itself as a "library for industrial-strength natural language processing in Python and Cython."
# 
# As a fair warning to those whoe want to run this notebook for themselves, some of the simulations take a really long time to run (~2  hrs), but joblib caches the results after the first run.
# 
# From here on out, the words will be much sparser than the code.

# # Import, load/clean/parse text
# See `utils.py` for cleaning and parsing details.

# There does appear to be an increasing trend for both average word and sentence length difference between the books, though the scale of the difference looks small compared to the standard deviations within each book.
# 
# One way to gauge the likelihood that the average word length difference between, say, books 1 and 2 is due to chance would be to   shuffle the labels a bunch of times, and each time calculate the difference in average word length. (See Jake VanderPlas' [Statistics for Hackers](https://speakerdeck.com/jakevdp/statistics-for-hackers) talk and [Tim Hesterberg's article](http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5279) covering permutation tests for an explanation). This shuffling lets us simulate the distribution for the word length differences--if we see that the actual difference in word length between books one and two fits in around the middle of this simulated distribution, then there's a good likelihood that the increase in average word length is small enough is simply due to chance. If the actual word length difference falls to the far upper edge of the distribution, we can be confident in rejecting the idea that the difference is due to chance, which many would take as sufficient evidence of an increasing complexity throughout the series.

# ## Word complexity by frequency
# 
# In addition to measuring the increase in average word/sentence length, it could be more insightful to measure the frequency of rarer words. My hypothesis was that even complex language is still largely composed of shorter, commoner words, highlighted by rarer, more complex words. A way to test this could be to somehow get a measure of the frequency of just the rarer words by counting, for example, what percentage of the words only appear once.

# ## Word complexity by English language frequency

# The frequency counting above, however, only counts words that are rare within the context of this series.

These will be negative numbers such that a lower score indicates that a word is less common in English usage outside of Harry Potter. "Low probability," "low likelihood" and "less common" are terms I'll use to describe words with low log-probability scores.

Measuring word complexity as having a low probability, this could lead one to say that the word complexity of the first book is way below average, as well as the 3rd and 4th to a lesser extent, with 5, 6 and 7 increasingly approaching the average. This seems to be the best evidence so far of the writing complexity increasing as Harry Potter's education progresses.

# The two features to compare across books that came to mind looking at this structure are the total height of the whole tree, and the depth of the nodes, averaged for each sentence.

# I plotted below, in each box, the trendline for the part of speech frequency (I believe the correct POS abbreviation mapping is described [here](https://universaldependencies.github.io/docs/en/pos/all.html)). The first box shows, for example, that nouns go from being about 26.4% of the words in book 1, to accounting for less 26% of the words in the final book. While the trends are interesting, I don't see anything pop out at me other than the number (NUM) and symbol (SYM) frequencies, which are too small for me to draw any conclusions from. I'm also not sure what conclusions one could draw simply based on part of speech counts--does more complex writing tend to have more verbs or adjectives?

# # Conclusion
# 
# This analysis has presented several possible metrics for measuring reading complexity across the Harry Potter series. Measuring the average word length and sentence length revealed statistically significant increases as the series progressed. While looking at the share of repeated words didn't appear to show a major trend, there did seem to be a discernible increase in uncommon word usage, defined by how often words appear in external bodies of English text. While the increasing book length accounted for part of the increase in uncommon words, attempting to correct for the book length showed a surprisingly large gap between the average probability of words in book 1 versus the rest. That is, the first book had a much larger share of common (or, as some might argue, more basic) words.
# 
# I also examined the average depth of the syntax trees of the sentences in each book. The average depth and, to a greater extent, the maximum depth, showed an increase throughout the series. While the difference between each of the consecutive book wasn't enormous, the difference between the first and fifth was quite large.
# 
# While not every angle described an increasing complexity, such as the share of part of speech tags, there does seem to be enough evidence among these metrics to confirm that they do indicate an increasing complexity throughout the series.

# ## Epilogue: fun stats

# #### Longest words, ordered by frequency

# In[ ]:

longs = Series([tok.orth_ for bk in bktksall.values() for tok in bk if len(tok.orth_) > 18]).value_counts(normalize=0)
for word, cnt in longs.items():
    print('{}: {}'.format(cnt, word))


# #### Longest unhyphenated words

# In[ ]:

Series([tok.orth_ for bk in bktksall.values()
        for tok in bk if len(tok.orth_) > 15
        and '-' not in tok.orth_]).value_counts(normalize=0)


# #### Tallest sentence in the series

# In[ ]:

_, maxsentnum, maxbooknum = sent_depths.ix[sent_depths.Depth.idxmax()]
[sent] = list(it.islice(bktksall[maxbooknum].sents, int(maxsentnum), int(maxsentnum + 1)))
print(sent)
show_graph(build_graph(sent))


# #### Longest sentences
# These seem to show some parsing issues, where a sequence of quick dialogue or lyrics are interpreted as a single sentence. Here are the two longest ones, filtering the number of newlines:

# In[ ]:

for s in [sent for _, bk in sorted(bktksall.items())
          for sent in bk.sents if (spanlen(sent) > 150) and
          (Counter(sent.string).get('\n', 0) < 3)]:
    print(Counter(s.string).get('\n', 0))
    print(s, end='\n\n=======\n\n')


# And here are some of the longest ones according to the parser, though it appears to be a bit confused:

# In[ ]:

for s in [sent for _, bk in sorted(bktksall.items())[:5] for sent in bk.sents if spanlen(sent) > 200]:
    print(s, end='\n\n=======\n\n')
